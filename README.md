## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Blockchain:**  
  Built on [Core Blockchain Testnet](https://coredao.org)

- **Consensus Mechanism:**  
  Core Blockchain‚Äôs Satoshi Plus combines Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), and Non-custodial Bitcoin Staking. This ensures a secure, efficient, and decentralized network with high performance and low transaction fees‚Äîideal for dApps like ours.

- **Chain Details:**
  - **Chain ID:** 1115 (hex: 0x45b)
  - **RPC URL:** [https://rpc.testnet.coredao.org](https://rpc.testnet.coredao.org)
  - **Block Explorer:** [https://scan.testnet.coredao.org](https://scan.testnet.coredao.org)
  - **Native Currency:** tCORE (18 decimals)

The dApp automatically prompts MetaMask to add or switch to the Core Testnet (Chain ID: 0x45b) when connecting a wallet, ensuring users are on the correct network.

### üìù Smart Contract

- **Language:** Solidity
- **Functionality:** Handles both the personality quiz logic and minting of soulbound NFTs.
- **Key Properties:**
  - Each user can mint only one NFT.
  - NFTs are non-transferable (soulbound) and tied to the wallet address.
- **Repository:**  
  [One Piece Personality dApp Smart Contract](https://github.com/rocknwa/one-piece-mint-contract)

**Soulbound Mechanism:**  
The smart contract enforces the soulbound property by restricting NFT transfers and limiting minting to one NFT per wallet address, ensuring the NFT remains a unique, personal collectible.

## ü™ô Getting Test Tokens for Core Testnet

To interact with the dApp and mint your soulbound NFT on the Core Testnet, you‚Äôll need test tokens (tCORE). Here‚Äôs how to get them:

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

- Ensure you have MetaMask installed (browser extension or mobile app).
- When you connect your wallet via the dApp, it will automatically prompt MetaMask to add the Core Testnet:
  - **Chain Name:** Core Blockchain Testnet
  - **Chain ID:** 1115 (0x45b)
  - **RPC URL:** https://rpc.testnet.coredao.org
  - **Block Explorer:** https://scan.testnet.coredao.org
  - **Currency Symbol:** tCORE

  If not added automatically, manually add it in MetaMask under ‚ÄúSettings > Networks > Add Network‚Äù using the above details.

### 2. Visit the Core Testnet Faucet

- Go to: [https://scan.testnet.coredao.org/faucet](https://scan.testnet.coredao.org/faucet)
- Or search ‚ÄúCore Testnet Faucet‚Äù on the official [Core Blockchain website](https://coredao.org) or community channels for updated links.

### 3. Request Test Tokens

- Copy your wallet address from MetaMask (e.g., `0x...`).
- Paste it into the faucet‚Äôs input field.
- Complete any verification (e.g., CAPTCHA), then submit the request.
- Most faucets provide 0.1‚Äì1 tCORE per request, enough for minting your NFT.
- Note: Some faucets may have daily limits or waiting periods for additional requests.

### 4. Verify Token Balance

- After receiving tokens, check your balance in MetaMask or in the [Core Testnet Block Explorer](https://scan.testnet.coredao.org).

### 5. Troubleshooting

- If tokens don‚Äôt arrive, ensure your wallet is connected to the Core Testnet (Chain ID: 1115).
- Check faucet status or try alternative faucets‚Äîsee Core Blockchain community (Discord, Telegram, etc.).
- If the faucet is out of funds, explore community-driven faucets on platforms like X or Core‚Äôs forums.

### 6. Using Test Tokens

- Use tCORE to pay for gas fees when minting your soulbound NFT. The dApp‚Äôs smart contract is optimized for low gas costs.
